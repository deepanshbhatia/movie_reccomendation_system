This Jupyter Notebook provides an analysis of a movie dataset, including data loading, exploration, and visualization. The notebook uses various Python libraries to process and analyze the data.

## Contents

1. **Introduction**: Overview of the notebook and objectives.
2. **Data Loading**: Instructions and code for loading the dataset.
3. **Data Exploration**: Initial exploration and summary statistics of the dataset.
4. **Data Visualization**: Various plots and visualizations to understand the data better.
5. **Modeling/Processing**: Any machine learning models or data processing steps applied to the dataset (if applicable).
6. **Conclusions**: Summary of findings and any final thoughts.

## Prerequisites

To run this notebook, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn (if applicable)

You can install these packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn sklearn
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. **Open the Notebook**: Navigate to the cloned repository and open the Jupyter Notebook file (`movie.ipynb`) using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook movie.ipynb
    ```

3. **Run the Cells**: Execute the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is assumed to be in a file named `movies_list.pkl`. This file should be in the same directory as the notebook.

## Key Functions and Code Snippets

- **Loading the Dataset**:
    ```python
    import pickle
    movies = pickle.load(open("movies_list.pkl", 'rb'))
    ```

- **Basic Data Exploration**:
    ```python
    print(movies.head())
    print(movies.info())
    print(movies.describe())
    ```

- **Visualization Example**:
    ```python
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import seaborn as sns

    plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
    sns.countplot(data=movies, x='genre')
    plt.title('Movie Genre Distribution')
    plt.show()
    ```

## Conclusion

This notebook provides a comprehensive analysis of the movie dataset, offering insights into the data through visualizations and statistical analysis. Feel free to modify and expand upon this notebook for further analysis or different datasets.
